#James Winestock Portfolio Design Guide
---
I have opted to make my my Portfolio site a simple, one page site in order to reduce clutter and increase the ease of finding useful information about me.
---
I have used the *Greyscale* Bootstrap theme as the template for my site. I liked its simple design and intuitiveness.
---
 My hero image is of a painting by Thomas Cole called The Savage State and is drawn from a series of 5 paintings called the *Course of Empire*. I used it as I feel it invokes a natural image that has the potential for creative growth. The dense forest mixed with the images of primitive human civilization is representative of nascent creative projects waiting for growth.
---
The rest of my page uses few images and large, readable text. The aim is to make information easily accessible and uncluttered. Large buttons help make it easy and intuitive for users to navigate to my Twitter, Github and LinkedIn.

I consulted *Color Lovers* to find a color pallet that worked with the Green of my Hero image and found #005656 (Coccothrinax gel) and #293131 (Dusty mono).
